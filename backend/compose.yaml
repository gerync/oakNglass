# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    # If your application depends on other services, you can specify them here.
    # For example, if your application depends on a database service called "db":
    db:
      image: postgres:latest
      environment:
        POSTGRES_USER: postgres
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD: FAR6ePi495xpU4xlXdSLELoYtBUfgABIXWjaKvhvYOLrWb3gx7eif2YZPxVFIETV
        POSTGRES_DB: oaknglass
      ports:
        - "5432:5432"
      volumes:
        - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
